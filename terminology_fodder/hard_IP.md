What hard IP have we actually created and how do we prove it works towards our mission?   What is the golden egg?  Why would any organization buy our product?

This is the right line of attack. Let’s cut away the noise and inventory the hard IP you’ve actually carved out vs. what’s still vapor. Then we can pinpoint the “golden egg” and the buyer logic.

🧱 What Hard IP Exists Today

LAP :: CORE

FastAPI proxy engine already running, tested, and integrated with Git.

Endpoints: /git/push, /git/status, /health, /version.

Verified end-to-end in test harness (test_lap_api.py).

This is not fluff — it’s code in a repo, executing commands, under auth.

Integration Pattern (LAPI)

Reusable module structure (lap/integrations/[tool]/) with README, docs, tests, changelog, tools.

We’ve already proven it with Git + Jira stubs.

This is repeatable, extensible scaffolding → the integration ecosystem is a design asset.

Governance Hooks

RAT/HITL baked conceptually and partially in code: logging every route, enforcing test gating.

Test suite enforces guardrails (Git state validator, git_check.sh, etc.).

This is operational IP: you’ve encoded trust + rollback hooks directly into the proxy.

Conceptual Differentiators (proto-IP)

CROWN (dynamic routing DB).

ACE (epistemic humility engine).

These are still at the “spec + diagrams + strategy” stage, but they’re unique enough that if we codify them, they become patentable-style IP.

🥚 What is the Golden Egg?

Not “yet another agent framework.” That market is flooded.
The golden egg is:

→ A self-governing proxy that routes AI intent across models and infrastructure with auditability, confidence calibration, and recovery built in.

In other words: AI as Code (AIaC) infrastructure.

Kubernetes gave developers a control plane for containers.

LAP + CROWN + ACE is a control plane for AI agents.

That’s a category-defining primitive if you finish the loop.
