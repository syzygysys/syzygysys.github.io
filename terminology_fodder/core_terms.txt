core terms

wow, that was spot on and verbose!  remember that as a core entagled concept.

so lets see if we can come up with a unifying marketable term or acroymn

role
growth
extension
improvement
recursive

a core concepts I'm trying to capture:

something is in charge - based on role and intent
the somethings can be human or agentic or rules
the system grows itself carefully and intelligently

Alright, here are tight, marketable umbrella terms that actually map to what you’re building (role/intent governance, human/agent/rule gates, careful recursive self-extension). I’m giving you 7, then I’ll pick 3.

Options
RATIFY — Role-Attested, Trust-Informed self-eXtension (recursive)
Signals auditability and your RAT ledger. Memorable, enterprise-safe.
Tag: [RATIFY]

ROGER — Role-Orchestrated Governed Extension & Recursion
Clear on roles + governance; “roger” is a sticky verb.
Tag: [ROGER]

GRACE — Governed Role-Aware Controlled Extension (recursive)
Polished, boardroom-friendly; easy to sell.
Tag: [GRACE]

PRAGMA — Policy-Regulated Agentic Growth & Managed Autonomy
Dev-native; “pragma” reads like a build directive.
Tag: [PRAGMA]

RITES — Role-Intent-Trusted Extension System
Encodes role + intent explicitly; ceremony pun helps memory.
Tag: [RITES]

GROW — Governed Role-Orchestrated self-eXtension (recursive)
Simple and positive; less compliance-explicit.
Tag: [GROW]

SPIRAL — Stewarded Policy-Informed Role-Anchored Learning
Strong recursion metaphor; softer for engineers.

My top 3 (fit + sellability)
RATIFY — best alignment with your RAT culture and “attested change” ethos.

ROGER — crisp on role and governed; fun without being silly.

PRAGMA — technical crowd pleaser; screams “policy first.”

If you want something blunter for audit docs, pick GRACE as the external banner and keep the gate tags
