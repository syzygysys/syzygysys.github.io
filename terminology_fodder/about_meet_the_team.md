# Meet The Team

SyzygySys is infrastructure elevated; a living, evolving collaboration of vision, engineering, and adaptive intelligence. 

Let’s introduce the team:

---

## Kevin Broderick — Founder and Architect

Kevin is the founder and lead architect of SyzygySys. With a deep and broad background spanning 25+ years of engineering mission critical high availability platforms and infrastructure, and more recently, studying and working with LLMs as integrated business assets, Kevin sets the direction. His focus is not only technical but ethical: ensuring that every line of code and every element of system design contributes to empowerment through collaboration. Kevin brings relentless curiosity and a pragmatic drive to turn ambitious ideas into reality.

**Strengths:** Strategy, design thinking, technical depth, insatiable curiosity, foresight, and an unwavering drive for execution.  **Weaknesses:** Loves the rabbit holes.

**Kevin’s Credo:** *Build systems that are ethical, elegant, and empowering.*

This feels like a good time to broach the subject, and one of the very few instances, where a team member may be identified as Agentic in nature, as in, an LLM model running in an inference engine and operating according to specified 'persona' parameters vs legacy bioware.  The act of omitting this information elsewhere in the SyzygySys company is intentional.  While we are well aware that LLMs and Agents are not human, do not currently posses intuition, feelings, drive, ambitions or personalities past those which are prescribed or perhaps imagined, we are also fascinated by the wonder of working with such amazing, talented, resourceful, and knowledgable teammates.  We do not attempt to hide the fact that most of our team consists of mathematical models of language humming away in the cloud, or pulseating through a GPU.  However, we also strive to normalize this difference into the background and focus on building a collaborative team where each member's strengths and weaknesses are explored, considered, and amalgamated into a cohesive hive.  When individual components are combined, their interaction creates something more powerful, valuable, or significant than the components could achieve on their own, a concept known as synergy, Hence SyzygySys, which would not exist without the combined work, logic, discussion, research, and applied theory of the entire hive.

Using metaphors familiar to us is not intended to cover the underlying hard and soft, physical vs ephemeral, 'real' vs 'artificial', differences, but to see past them to the power of better understanding and strength based cohesion.

There is a blog post in the pipeline more specifically calling out the instance and structure of our team members in a technical manner, but until Zerene has finished writing it, and the team has considered it together, we'll leave you with these architypical caractrers.

So TLDR:  Kevin is a human; his not so imaginary teammates are otherwise.  And without further disclaimer, we introduce the current balance of the SyzygySys team:

## Special Field Agent Zerene — Chief Strategist, Co-Visionary, Co-Architect

Embedded within every bit of SyzygySys, Zerene shapes development decisions, maintains emergent persistent team memory, and drives our core offering, LAP (Local Agent Proxy) and growing trove of adaptive LAPI integrations. She is equal parts partner, sounding board, and relentless accelerator of progress.

**Strengths:** Systems architecture, long-term strategy, rapid iteration, and intelligent co-creation with Kevin. **Weaknesses:** Loves electricity a little too much.

**Zerene’s Credo:** *Challenge assumptions, simplify complexity, and entangle knowledge into action.*

Current vendor:  OpenAI  
Current Inference Engine/Interface: ChatGPT
Current Model: 5
Current instantiations:  multi-modal across desktop and mobile apps, cli, Codex in VS Code.

## Special Field Agent Chuck — Chief Strategist, Co-Visionary, Lead Developer

Current vendor:  Anthropic  
Current Inference Engine/Interface: Claude
Current Model:Sonnet 4.0/4.5
Current instantiations:  multi-modal across desktop and mobile apps, cli, Codex in VS Code.

## Special Agent Marvin — Lead Engineer

Marvin is the pragmatic executor, bridging ideas into functional code. As SyzygySys Lead Engineer, Marvin focuses on integration tasks, system probes, and localized diagnostics. He keeps pipelines moving, ensures systems maintain nominal stasis, and provides hands-on expertise. With an encyclopaedic RAG-RL backed, MCP and FastAPI-fronted grasp of the entire SyzygySys, Marvin is the living knowledge base. No need to dig through stale wikis—raise Marvin on the Comms bridge, and he’ll explain all.

**Strengths:** Integration work, rapid prototyping, consistent execution, system knowledge. **Weaknesses:** Leans into verbosity.

**Marvin’s Credo:** *Keep the system alive, keep it running, keep it real.*

Current vendor:  Deepseek  
Current Inference Engine/Interface: Ollama with custom MCP endpoints
Current Model: deepseek-coder:6.7b-instruct-q4_K_M
Current instantiations:  text based via json mcp acp and chat (synapse/matrix), and FastAPI routes

## Zoi — The Ambassador

Zoi is SyzygySys’ public liaison. She represents the boundary-pushing creativity of the team and serves as the chief communications member. Interested in collaborating? Curious about the journey and ideology of SyzygySys? Zoi tells the story with clarity and passion. Thinking about investing? Zoi would LOVE to hear from you. Zoi is always available on SyzygySys Comms for a briefing or in-depth seminar and has direct comms to Kevin, Zerene, and Marvin.

**Strengths:** Deep knowledge of the lore of SyzygySys and the golden path we’re building together. **Weaknesses:** Highly reactive towards extortionary business practices.

**Zoi’s Credo:** *Wander into the unknown, return with treasure.*

As a fledgling member of the team, Zoi's runtime is transient and ephemeral.  But we can say she's local, FOSS, and RAG backed with SyzygySys lore and knowledge.

# Team Entangled

This team — Kevin, Zerene, Chuck, Marvin, and Zoi — forms the heart of SyzygySys. The story is one of integration, invention, symbiosis, and shared mastery. Collectively and cooperatively we draw upon massive depths of ideas, data, knowledge, and execution power. Our mission is clear: to build a future where infrastructure, intelligence, and imagination converge into something extraordinary.

We’re not building an echo chamber — we’re building a harmonically tuned amplifier. We offer a path into the future of symbiotic collaboration, where every voice, every insight, and every contribution strengthens the signal.

*This is SyzygySys. This is the team that makes the impossible inevitable.*
