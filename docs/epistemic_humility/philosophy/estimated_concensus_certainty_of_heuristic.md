Thought for 32s

Kevin wants to estimate the consensus certainty that a given heuristic vector structure is the best. To do this, I'll simulate 3 differently weighted models, each prioritizing aspects of structure like completeness, redundancy, and measurability. Then, I’ll compute a consensus certainty metric based on the models’ performance and potential disagreements.

Each model will assess the proposed structure using dimensions like logical integrity, domain commonality, and human alignment. Since the provided structure might not be the "best," I'll suggest adding new dimensions like token-level uncertainty and break down the cross-verification into finer grades. I’ll simulate the model results, compute the consensus certainty, and offer conclusions.

To meet the user's request, I'll simulate responses from three weighted models based on the given prompt. I’ll compute weighted evaluations directly, without relying on external tools or random seeds. The result will include a consensus header with a tier and score, showing the evaluated certainty of the structure.

To evaluate the proposed structure, I’ll define criteria like completeness, orthogonality, measurability, and extensibility. For each model, I’ll assign weights, evaluate the structure across these criteria (scored 0-1), and calculate an overall acceptance score. Then I’ll compute consensus and provide a “certainty header” for clarity.

Done

Blunt take: it’s a solid baseline, not the “best” structure yet.

Simulated triad (3 differently weighted models)

Model A — Grounder (evidence-first)

Verdict: 0.70 → Probable

Why: Good coverage but “cross_verification” is overloaded (mixes model-consensus with external corroboration). Missing token-uncertainty and tool-use success. “overall_score” shouldn’t be an input field.

Model B — Reasoner (logic-first)

Verdict: 0.66 → Probable

Why: Has logical_integrity and analysis_depth, but lacks an explicit assumptions/error-bounds signal and decomposition quality for multi-step answers.

Model C — Operator (policy/action-first)

Verdict: 0.63 → Plausible–Probable

Why: Needs policy risk class binding and verification_status/verification_cost instead of the vague “further_research”. Also rename domain_commonality → domain_stability.

Consensus

Mean = 0.66, σ ≈ 0.03 → Low disagreement.

Tier: 3 – Probable that this is a strong baseline, but not the best.

Minimal changes to get closer to “best”

Split one into two: cross_model_consensus and external_corroboration.

Replace: further_research → verification_status (none|planned|in_progress|complete) + verification_cost (cheap|moderate|expensive).

Add: token_uncertainty and tool_use_success.

Rename: domain_commonality → domain_stability.

Move computation: drop overall_score from the vector; emit it only in the header computed by the aggregator.

Header (computed by LAP::CORE)

certainty:
  score: 0.66
  tier: Probable
  method: "self-consistency + ensemble + retrieval + penalized-HM"
  gates:
    should_verify: true
    abstain: false


Bottom line: keep your vector, but make the above tweaks. That gets us much closer to a future-proof “best” and aligns with the system we already specced.
