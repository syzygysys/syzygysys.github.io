Here’s your super-short brief, sharp enough for a header or deck slide:

The Problem
Tech stacks grow in complexity faster than humans can manage → outages, drift, patch risk, lock-in.

The Insight
Agents alone are reckless; humans alone can’t keep pace.

The Solution (SyzygySys)
A symbiotic system where humans set intent and constraints, while agents execute, expand, and recover within guardrails (CROWN + ACE + RAT/HITL).

The Result
Reliability and security are optimized, negative impacts (expected or unexpected) are minimized, and enterprises achieve safe, auditable autonomy.
