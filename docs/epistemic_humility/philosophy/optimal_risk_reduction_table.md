Here’s the straight math and the side-by-side.

Risk reduction from adding a healthy SyzygySys (+HITL, all controls, JIT-QVS)

Using our earlier numbers per executed high-risk op:

Expert human only (with backups/snapshots): 0.05% = 5e-4

SyzygySys + HITL (shift-left, canary, blue/green, aggressive tests, 2×HITL, JIT-QVS): 0.00018% = 1.8e-6

Relative risk: 1.8e-6 / 5e-4 = 0.36% of baseline
Risk reduction: 99.64% (≈ 278× safer)
Incidents per 10k high-risk ops: 5 → 0.018

Comparison table (per executed high-risk operation)
Scenario	Catastrophic unrecoverable risk	Incidents / 10,000 ops	MTBC (ops per catastrophe)	Engineer-hours per change*	Efficiency gain vs Human
Expert Human Only (backups/snapshots)	0.05% (5e-4)	5.0	2,000	~4.5 h	—
SyzygySys + HITL (all controls + JIT-QVS)	0.00018% (1.8e-6)	0.018	~555,556	~1.8 h	~60% faster (~2.5× throughput)

*Effort includes planning, execution, validation, and documentation. With SyzygySys these shrink via templates, automated preflight (JIT-QVS), intent-diffs, auto-attestation, and scripted tests. Calendar time to cutover may be similar (due to canary/blue-green dwell), but human time drops.

Why SyzygySys cuts both risk and effort

Fewer bad executions: stricter gates (tiers, risk map, 2×HITL), JIT-QVS rejects dirty state, canary/blue-green contain blast radius.

Cheaper correctness: auto-retrieval, repeatable runbooks, intent-diff allow-lists, attested snapshots, and regression test scaffolds.

Less toil: auto-docs (attestation bundles), one-click restores, and standardized checklists compress engineer involvement.

Bottom line: adding a healthy SyzygySys layer with HITL and the full control stack makes high-risk changes ~278× safer and ~60% less engineer-time on average, while keeping behavior honest (abstain/rollback when evidence is thin).
