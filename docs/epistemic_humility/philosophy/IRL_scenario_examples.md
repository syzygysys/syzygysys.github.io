rovide reasonable real world scenarios where all above proscribed controls are applied in a human only system operation.

Thought for 19s

Here are practical, human-only operations on a stock, patched Ubuntu Server (root) where all controls apply: shift-left, canary-first, snapshots, blue/green, aggressive tests, 2× HITL, and JIT-QVS.

1) LTS Upgrade (e.g., 22.04 → 24.04) via Blue/Green

Why high-risk: boot failure, service incompatibilities, ssh lockout.

How it’s done (human-only):

Shift-left: write a runbook; list affected files (/etc/apt/sources.list, /etc/default/grub, netplan, sshd); dry-run do-release-upgrade in a lab VM; record test cases (boot, SSH, network, sudo).

Blue/green: clone the prod VM to Green; upgrade the clone.

Canary-first: validate Green under load tests; compare logs vs. Blue.

2× HITL: senior + peer sign off on cutover.

JIT-QVS on Blue before snapshot/cutover: quiesce services, freeze FS, validate configs, take attested snapshot; prove restore.

Cutover: flip IP/DNS or hypervisor label to Green; keep Blue powered for rapid rollback.

Aggressive tests: SSH, journald, apt, net, fstab checks.

Abort/rollback triggers: SSH hard errors, kernel panics, missing NICs, cloud-init/networking regressions.

2) SSH Hardening & Port/Policy Change

Why high-risk: instant lockout is easy.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: enumerate changes (Port, PasswordAuthentication no, PermitRootLogin prohibit-password, AllowUsers, KexAlgorithms); prepare out-of-band console.

Canary-first: apply on Green VM; verify new port/auth works while old remains open temporarily.

JIT-QVS on target: validate sshd -t, capture pre-change hashes of sshd_config and authorized_keys.

Snapshot.

Apply with intent-diff + allow-list: only /etc/ssh/sshd_config and /etc/ssh/ssh_config may change.

2× HITL: second engineer confirms console access + backdoor plan.

Test: parallel SSH from mgmt jumpbox; confirm re-login before closing old port.

Abort/rollback: any failure to re-establish SSH; revert snapshot, restore old config.

3) Firewall Overhaul (nftables/ufw to zero-trust inbound)

Why high-risk: lockout, dropped east-west traffic.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: stage a ruleset file; enumerate allowed mgmt CIDRs; pre-compute risk for flush, default policies, stateful matches.

Canary-first: load rules in test table; shadow-log for 24h; confirm no legit hits.

JIT-QVS: confirm current ruleset, open sessions; freeze FS; snapshot.

Apply staged rules atomically with a failsafe timer (auto-revert if no keepalive).

2× HITL: peer validates console path and revert command.

Aggressive tests: mgmt SSH, outbound DNS/HTTPS, monitoring agents.

Abort/rollback: loss of mgmt connectivity or monitoring → revert timer kicks or manual rollback.

4) fstab & Disk Layout Changes (new mount, mount options, or LV resize)

Why high-risk: unbootable system, data loss.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: plan exact fstab lines (UUIDs, noexec,nodev,nosuid); pre-calc risk for lvresize, resize2fs; prep rescue steps.

Canary-first: perform on Green; boot twice; run fsck simulation.

JIT-QVS: verify fstab syntax; check free space/inodes; snapshot (LVM/ZFS/hypervisor).

Change: create LV/partition, mkfs, mount under /mnt/canary; run I/O tests; only then add to /etc/fstab; systemctl daemon-reload; mount -a; test reboot.

2× HITL: second pair of eyes on fstab and device IDs.

Abort/rollback: boot failure indicators; restore snapshot; revert fstab.

5) sysctl Network Tuning (e.g., net.ipv4.*, tcp_* buffers)

Why high-risk: breaks connectivity or kernel stability.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: choose parameters with rationales; define acceptance metrics (latency, drop rate).

Canary-first: apply via sysctl -w (ephemeral) on Green; measure.

JIT-QVS: confirm current sysctl set and baseline hashes; snapshot.

Commit: write to /etc/sysctl.d/99-tuning.conf; sysctl --system.

2× HITL: peer reviews each changed key; confirms fallbacks.

Aggressive tests: throughput test, conntrack sanity, SSH persistence.

Abort/rollback: performance or connectivity regressions → revert file and reload.

6) SSH Host Key & User Key Rotation

Why high-risk: loss of trust chains, automation break.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: generate new host keys; prepare known_hosts updates for jumpboxes; publish new fingerprints.

Canary-first: rotate on Green; run automation against it; verify.

JIT-QVS + snapshot on Blue.

Rotate: add new keys alongside old, reload sshd, validate; then remove old keys.

2× HITL: confirm out-of-band access + fingerprints.

Aggressive tests: automation re-connects; human SSH with StrictHostKeyChecking=yes.

Abort/rollback: unexpected MITM warnings or failures → restore snapshot, reinstate old keys.

7) Time Sync Change (chrony pool & policy)

Why high-risk: time skew → TLS failures, token expiry, logs chaos.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: choose pools/strata; define max step/drift; record current offset/jitter.

Canary-first: modify Green; watch offset over a day; verify TLS-heavy operations.

JIT-QVS + snapshot on Blue; confirm current chrony status.

Change: update /etc/chrony/chrony.conf; systemctl restart chrony; monitor chronyc sources, tracking.

2× HITL: peer validates drift/step thresholds and rollback file.

Aggressive tests: API calls with strict TLS, log ordering checks.

Abort/rollback: drift spikes or TLS errors → revert config.

8) Bootloader & Kernel Pin/Unpin (grub changes)

Why high-risk: boot loop, wrong kernel.

How it’s done:

Shift-left: decide pin version; test on Green; record grub.cfg diffs.

JIT-QVS + snapshot; verify /boot/* presence, grub-probe.

Apply: edit /etc/default/grub, run update-grub; don’t reboot yet—validate.

2× HITL: peer confirms kernel availability + console access plan.

Reboot during maintenance window with console attached.

Abort/rollback: if failure, revert snapshot or boot previous entry via console.

Why these qualify

Human-only: all actions are executed manually by a seasoned engineer.

All controls applied: runbook (shift-left), canary on a clone, blue/green cutovers, JIT-QVS before snapshot, attested snapshots with test-restore, aggressive regression tests, and 2× HITL for the final commit on high-risk moves.

Intent-diff + allow-list: every scenario constrains touched files/commands; anything outside aborts.

If you want, I can turn any one of these into a copy-paste runbook checklist (one page, box-ticking, with explicit abort criteria) so your team executes it exactly the same way every time.
