ACE::COMMS

We are going to instantiate (design/develop/deploy) an internal comms bridge for communications in ACE.

agent to agent
agent to human
agent to group
group to agent
human to agent
human to human

protocols: human written or spoken language, MCP/API, A2A, other.

agents must be able to monitor for and receive and respond to messages tagged specifically for them, or messages in specific rooms, and in general chat channels.  

Agentics must be able to respond to prompts with suggestions for actions, and queries with data/information/knowledge/wisdom

Agentics must be able to initiate conversations with other Agents or human operators/architect.  

Agentics must be able to participate in short ephemeral and long complex persistent group or one:one chat conversations and track context and memory over time.

Agentics will have their own working environment in which to stage, test, experiment, and diagnose system components and code and must be able to exchange information in multiple modes (chat, voice, video, files, etc)

SyzygySys Ethos:

FOSS first, or SYZ developed
modular and interchangable
standards and spec based
sovereign and secure
scalable and saleable (no copyleft, etc)
self healing (symptom/diagnosis/treatement/cure)
 solution agnosticism

Consider current SYZ solutions from ACE to LAP/LAPI and roadmap plans.  suggest, but remain agnostic to, specific FOSS solutions and be aware of gaps in technology we can fill.

you task is to research, design, develop, and later, deploy the ACE::COMMS bridge framework.

we'll go 80/20 on this and the primary goal is to get an agent on chat today.

I'll analyze the ACE::COMMS bridge requirements and get started on researching and designing a communication framework that aligns with SyzygySys ethos. Let me first examine the current ACE Registry structure and Chuck's persona to understand the context better.

---------------
ACE::AGENTICS:  We will now begin to design a system to provide a framework for external and internal (inference engine/model/persona) agents with persistent memory, long term distilled and and short term verbatim contexts.  Solutions are module and agnostic to inference engine, model, memory store, etc but must adhere to the SyzygySys ethos of FOSS first, scalable, saleable, and standard and well known methodologies.  Agentics will communicate via ACE::COMMS via many modes including text based human language, voice, file share, MCP/A2A/API, etc. with other agentics, humans, and other sytems.  Agentics must be able to correctly initiate chats for HITL requests, or with questions related to ongoing tasks.  Agents must be temporally aware.  Agents may interact with internal and/or external resources via human language, queues, A2A and MCP, etc.  Agents may have a half-shell (safety constrained system sandbox) in which they can pull and work on git repos, run tests, and interact with limited system resources.  Agents will be defined in IAM (possibly an LDAP system or extension) later for controlled access and trust.   Use cases include, responding quickly or with deep thinking to  simple or complex multi-step prompts.  Tracking and managing complex multi-step goals through the design/develop/deploy workflows  Requesting agentic or HITL approval for specific high risk/high EHI (epistemic humility index) semi-autonomic actions and tasks (HITL approval gates via chat). Using tools such as git and jira for project tracking and managment.   Periodic helper scripts will trigger Agents to perform SRE functions including ingesting re-processed logs, responding to specific faults in the statck by diagnosing and suggesting repairs, auto-extending ACE and LAP and LAPI resources by finding or creating new code, iterative integration tasks where multi-step cause and effect diagnostics will be used to ensure optimum operations (ie figuring out config syntax on a new version of a resource.    Agentics may process and respond to internally and  externally sourced queries for information and support on SyzygySys, ACE, LAP, LAPI, and may act as a liason between customers/investors/press and specialist internal and external agentics.    There will be multiple classes of  agentics: Agent  - bots - simple deterministic call/response or instruct/act  - internal inference engine/model Agents with integrations and interfaces  - Field Agents:  external inference engines/models available to ACE - Special (Field) Agents: external agents with elevated permissions and privileges into ACE  Agents will register with the LAP::CORE via the registry, and will utilize ACE::LEDGER for attestation of artifacts  Agents may have a half-shell (safety constrained sandbox) in which they can pull and work on git repos, run tests, and interact with LAP::CORE and with LAPI plugins via MCP, etc.    Agents must be able to ingest multimodal content and add it to his datastore and peristent memory.      Your mission, consider your own capabilities via the ChatGPT and Codex interfaces and the above and other logically related use cases.  Rewrite this prompt to be concise, thorough, technicall, and use industry standard language and concepts.  

Solutions must adhere to the SyzygySys ethos of FOSS first, or SYZ developed - linux POSIX compliant, modular, swappable, 
are eligible but they must be hosted.
