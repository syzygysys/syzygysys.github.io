**Agent Certainty Engine (ACE): Epistemic Confidence and Humility in AI Reasoning**

## Abstract
The Agent Certainty Engine (ACE) is a mechanism for quantifying, communicating, and calibrating the epistemic confidence of AI agent outputs. ACE is designed to solve the critical pain point of unqualified answers in generative AI systems, which erodes trust, increases cost through retries, and leads to operational brittleness. ACE introduces a certainty score model, balancing precision with epistemic humility, and provides a standardized interface for reasoning transparency.

## Motivation
Just as networking protocols require clear routing metrics to ensure stability and predictability, AI orchestration requires explicit measures of confidence. Current LLM agents frequently respond with high-entropy outputs without conveying how certain they are of correctness. This results in:
- Poor human-in-the-loop (HITL) efficiency.
- Overreliance on post-hoc evaluation (RAT, eval harnesses).
- Difficulty routing tasks to the most reliable sub-agent.

ACE fills this gap by embedding certainty vectors into every response, enabling systematic trust calibration.

## Architecture
- Inputs: Prompt, context, retrieved knowledge.
- Outputs: Response payload + ACE Certainty Vector.

**ACE Certainty Vector Example:**
```json
{
  "epistemic_confidence": 0.73,
  "uncertainty_factors": {
    "knowledge_gap": 0.4,
    "ambiguity": 0.2,
    "hallucination_risk": 0.3
  },
  "justification": "Low retrieval overlap with verified context. Potential semantic drift."
}
```

## Key Principles
1. Epistemic humility: Default to disclosing uncertainty rather than masking.
2. Calibrated scoring: Certainty scores tied to empirical eval benchmarks.
3. Composability: Works across multiple agents (ACE vectors can be compared/aggregated).
4. HITL optimization: Drives user workflows to focus review where confidence is lowest.

## Applications
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Decision audit trails
- Adaptive prompting

## RFC Status
ACE v0.1 specification. Future extensions: hierarchical certainty models, ACE-driven active learning loops.
