# SyzygySys — Investor Blurb (Concise)

**SyzygySys** is the **sovereign AI operations layer**: a FOSS-first, standards-based agent platform that orchestrates and audits enterprise workflows—designed to scale, swap components freely, and **run itself** via a self-healing loop. We commercialize with an open-core model (no copyleft drag) so customers get control without lock-in.
