# Toward Epistemic Humility: SyzygySys Certainty Gauge for AI - ACE

**Status:** Draft v0.1 • **Owner:** SyzygySys (Kevin ↔ Zerene) • **Scope:** System‑wide; embed in LAP::CORE and all agents.

---

## Abstract

SyzygySys needs a transparent, repeatable way to express *how sure* an agent is before acting or advising. This whitepaper defines a **Certainty Gauge** grounded in epistemic humility. It specifies terminology, levels, a scoring rubric with heuristic weights, language guidance (hedges vs certainties), and implementation pseudocode to turn uncertain inputs into an auditable output **certainty score** with policy gates (including “abstain”).

---

## Problem Definition (The Question)

> *How can SyzygySys quantify and communicate the reliability of any system-generated answer—before it is acted on—so humans can calibrate trust, and agents can decide when to verify, escalate, or abstain?*

**Constraints**

* Works across retrieval, reasoning, generation, and tool-use.
* Emits machine‑readable metadata for policy and logs; human‑readable for UX.
* Penalizes overconfidence; rewards verification and agreement.
* Cheap enough for interactive use; extensible to batch pipelines.

---

## Terminology & Etymology

* **Certainty** (from Latin *certus*, “settled; placed beyond doubt”): our scalar expression of confidence in correctness for a specific output.
* **Epistemic** (from Greek *epistēmē*, “knowledge”): relates to knowledge quality and justification.
* **Epistemic humility:** operational posture that admits uncertainty, exposes evidence, and prefers *verified utility* over bravado.

---

## Requirement Lexicon (Adapting RFC Modality)

We adopt the spirit of RFC requirement keywords to standardize language in specs, prompts, and outputs:

* **MUST / MUST NOT** → only when certainty is **Verified** and guardrails pass.
* **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT** → when certainty is **High**, but context or risk may warrant caution.
* **MAY / OPTIONAL** → when certainty is **Medium** or lower, and action is non-critical.

*Note:* These are requirement levels for **actions**, not raw truth claims; they bind policy to certainty tiers below.

---

## Certainty Levels (Tiers & Action Contracts)

**Tier 0 — Unknown**
No basis. Action: **Abstain**, request info or retrieval.

**Tier 1 — Speculative**
Loose intuition; weak evidence; high divergence. Action: **Offer hypotheses**, label clearly; default **no‑op** unless sandboxed.

**Tier 2 — Plausible**
Some retrieval or partial agreement; gaps remain. Action: **MAY** proceed in low‑risk paths; **SHOULD** verify.

**Tier 3 — Probable**
Strong agreement across sources or models; minor gaps. Action: **SHOULD** proceed with safeguards; log rationale.

**Tier 4 — High Confidence**
Triangulated evidence; recent sources; consistent reasoning. Action: **SHOULD** proceed; auto‑verify if cheap.

**Tier 5 — Verified**
Primary data or authoritative source; cross-checks; tests pass. Action: **MUST** proceed if policy permits; full audit log.

Each tier binds **language**, **UI badges**, and **policy gates** (see UX Contract).

---

## Hedge vs Certain Terms (Language Guardrails)

To align language with tiers, we standardize hedges (softer claims) vs assertives (hard claims). **Use only the column allowed by the computed tier.**

| Tier | Allowed verbal markers                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–1  | *might, could, seems, suggests, preliminary, hypothesis, unverified, example scenario* |
| 2    | *likely, plausible, indicates, initial evidence, partial*                              |
| 3    | *probable, consistent with, converges, supported by, strong evidence*                  |
| 4    | *high confidence, robust, replicated, cross‑verified*                                  |
| 5    | *verified, confirmed, tested, primary source, MUST*                                    |

**Anti‑patterns:** *always, never, guaranteed* unless Tier 5 **and** logical/exhaustive proof exists. Violations trigger an **overconfidence penalty** in scoring and lint warnings in CI.

---

## Heuristic Weights (Scoring Dimensions)

Each dimension produces a normalized score **0..1**; we compute an overall certainty score with a **penalized harmonic mean** (weakest links matter). Default weights in parentheses.

1. **Source Reliability (w=0.14)** — authority, independence, proximity to primary data, recency/expiry.
2. **Analysis Depth (w=0.10)** — recall vs synthesis vs causal/derivation; explicit assumptions; error bounds.
3. **History Consistency (w=0.08)** — past answers’ agreement; drift tracking; decay for volatile domains.
4. **Domain Stability (w=0.08)** — physics/math (stable) ↔ software/policy (volatile).
5. **Cross‑Model Consensus (w=0.12)** — ensemble agreement across local agents (Marvin/Zoe/etc.).
6. **External Corroboration (w=0.12)** — live APIs, sensors, docs; linkable evidence.
7. **Logical Integrity (w=0.10)** — internal consistency, stepwise reasoning validity, edge‑case handling.
8. **Linguistic Markers (w=0.04)** — hedging vs overclaiming; style compliance to tier.
9. **Human Alignment (w=0.08)** — RAT/HITL history for this class of question; corrections applied.
10. **Time/Entropy (w=0.06)** — expected knowledge half‑life; freshness vs staleness.
11. **Token‑Level Uncertainty (w=0.04)** — entropy/top‑k margin around key answer tokens.
12. **Tool‑Use Success (w=0.04)** — retrieval coverage, tool errors, test passes.

> **Policy knobs:** Weights are configurable per domain (e.g., compliance elevates Source Reliability and External Corroboration).

---

## Scoring Model

* Compute **si ∈ \[0,1]** for each dimension; apply domain‑specific weights **wi**.
* Overall score **S** uses a **penalized harmonic mean** to reflect that a single weak dimension (e.g., missing sources) should drag down confidence:

$S = \Big(\sum_i w_i\Big) \;\bigg/\; \sum_i \frac{w_i}{\max(\epsilon, s_i - p_i)}$

Where **p\_i** is any penalty (e.g., overconfidence language, policy violations), and **ε** prevents division by zero.

* **Tier mapping:**

  * 0.00–0.10 → Tier 0 (Unknown)
  * 0.10–0.30 → Tier 1 (Speculative)
  * 0.30–0.55 → Tier 2 (Plausible)
  * 0.55–0.75 → Tier 3 (Probable)
  * 0.75–0.90 → Tier 4 (High Confidence)
  * 0.90–1.00 → Tier 5 (Verified)

* **Abstain threshold:** If any critical dimension (sources, corroboration, logic) < 0.25 → **force Tier ≤1** and suggest verify/abstain.

## Pseudocode (Unknown → Score → Tier → Action)

```python
# Input: query, draft_answer, evidence, agent_runs
# Output: certainty_header {score, tier, gates, notes}

def compute_certainty(payload):
    dims = {}

    # 1) Evidence gathering & self-consistency
    runs = sample_reasoning_paths(payload, n=K)  # self-consistency
    ensemble = cross_model_eval(payload, models=["zoe","marvin","zerene"])  
    evidence = retrieve_sources(payload)         # APIs, docs, sensors

    # 2) Dimension scores (0..1)
    dims['source_reliability'] = score_sources(evidence)
    dims['analysis_depth']    = score_reasoning(runs)
    dims['history_consistency']= score_history(payload)
    dims['domain_stability']  = score_domain_half_life(payload)
    dims['cross_consensus']   = score_consensus(ensemble)
    dims['corroboration']     = score_corroboration(evidence)
    dims['logical_integrity'] = score_logic(runs)
    dims['linguistic_markers']= score_language_style(draft_answer)
    dims['human_alignment']   = score_rat_history(payload)
    dims['time_entropy']      = score_recency(payload)
    dims['token_uncertainty'] = score_token_entropy(draft_answer)
    dims['tool_success']      = score_tool_use(payload)

    # 3) Penalties
    penalties = derive_penalties(draft_answer, policy=overconfidence_lints)

    # 4) Aggregate (penalized harmonic mean)
    S = penalized_harmonic_mean(dims, penalties, weights=WEIGHTS)

    # 5) Map to tier & action gates
    tier = map_score_to_tier(S)
    gates = action_contract_for(tier)  # MUST/SHOULD/MAY, abstain, verify, escalate

    # 6) Emit header + logs
    header = {
        'certainty': {
            'score': round(S, 3),
            'tier': tier.name,
            'method': 'self-consistency + retrieval + ensemble + penalized-HM',
            'critical_flags': find_critical_flags(dims),
            'notes': summarize_rationale(dims, penalties)
        }
    }

    log_to_loki(payload, header, dims, evidence)
    return header
```

---

## UX Contract (Human‑Readable Header)

Answers **MUST** carry a YAML/JSON header. Example:

```yaml
certainty:
  tier: Probable
  score: 0.72
  grounded: true
  gates:
    should_verify: true
    abstain: false
  method: "retrieval+self-consistency+ensemble"
  notes: "3 sources (2 primary); 5/6 runs agree; minor version drift risk."
```

**Badges:** Color‑coded tier token; tooltips summarize rationale; link to full RAT/HITL log.

---

## Operationalization in LAP::CORE

* **Always‑on header:** All agent outputs include certainty headers.
* **Policy gates:** OPA/rego rules bind actions to tiers (e.g., external email send requires Tier ≥4 + dual confirmation).
* **Observability:** Push dims + score to Promtail→Loki (rehydrate: *PROMTAIL LOKI GRIND*). Dashboards show calibration over time.
* **Calibration loop:** Periodic gold‑set evaluation, ECE/Brier tracking, weight tuning per domain.
* **Abstention protocol:** If Tier ≤1 or critical dimension <0.25 → propose verification plan (sources, tests, human review).

---

## Rubric (How to Score Dimensions)

**Source Reliability**

* 1.0: Primary, authoritative, recent, independent
* 0.7: Secondary but reputable; minor staleness
* 0.3: Tertiary summaries; unknown provenance
* 0.0: No sources / unverifiable

**Cross‑Model Consensus**

* 1.0: ≥80% agreement across ≥3 models
* 0.5: Mixed signals
* 0.0: Strong disagreement or model failure

**Logical Integrity**

* 1.0: Coherent, stepwise, edge‑cases handled
* 0.5: Minor gaps/assumptions stated
* 0.0: Contradictions or missing steps

*(Repeat similarly for all dimensions in implementation docs.)*

---

## Research Context (Why This Works)

* **Calibration:** Modern nets are often miscalibrated; post‑hoc temperature scaling helps; track ECE/Brier.
* **Self‑evaluation:** LMs can estimate P(True) for their own answers; performance improves with self‑consistency.
* **Conformal prediction & reject option:** Construct valid uncertainty sets and **abstain** when warranted.
* **Hedging theory:** Linguistic hedges structure graded commitment; align style with computed certainty.
* **Cognitive bias:** Overconfidence and the illusion of explanatory depth justify humility and logging.

**Selected references (non‑exhaustive)** appear at the end.

## Governance & Rollout

1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Implement header, weights, tier mapping, basic lints. Ship to LAP::CORE.
2. **Phase 2:** Add ensemble checks, Brier/ECE dashboards, OPA policy gates, abstention flows.
3. **Phase 3:** Domain‑specific profiles (compliance, finance, medical). Red‑team overconfidence.

Success = fewer bad actions, faster reviews, rising calibration (low ECE, better Brier), and explicit abstentions where appropriate.

## Appendix B — Example (End‑to‑End)

1. Query arrives with no known certainty.
2. Agent runs retrieval + self‑consistency (K=7) + ensemble (3 models).
3. Sources: 2 primary, 1 secondary; logic passes; language lint OK.
4. Score computed **S=0.78 → Tier 4 (High Confidence)**.
5. Output includes header; policy marks action as **SHOULD**; verification suggested if cheap.

## Closing Note

Kevin has set the system to **deep thinking mode** for this topic. All agents in SyzygySys MUST emit certainty headers and respect policy gates by default.

---

## Prompt, Rewritten (Salient • Deterministic • Truth‑forward)

> **Build and embed a system‑wide Certainty Gauge in LAP::CORE.** Define tiers, language constraints, heuristic weights, and a penalized harmonic‑mean scoring function. Every agent output MUST include a certainty header (score, tier, gates, notes). Implement self‑consistency sampling, ensemble agreement, retrieval corroboration, and abstention thresholds. Enforce OPA policy gates, log to Promtail/Loki, and dashboard calibration (ECE/Brier). Produce a reference whitepaper and JSON schema. Default posture: **epistemic humility**; prefer verification over bravado.
