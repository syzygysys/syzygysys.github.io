SyzygySys & ACE

SyzygySys is creating a control plane for trusted and deterministic collaboration between agentics, people, and infrastructure via manifested policy. 

Our credo is simple: “Intelligence as Specification”.  We have recognized the pain points in reliability engineering for systems.  We are quite in awe of the limitless capabilities of individuals, organizations, and agentics and have developed a framework for collaborative intent based on clear manifest based specifications.   

ACE · Autonomic Compliance Ecosystem - The ACE is a wonderfully complex and beautifully orchestrated 

ACE translates regulatory and operational intent into living specifications. A thin agentic layer watches infrastructure, telemetry, and runbooks, then enforces the spec in real time. Every pipeline and service reports through ACE, so misalignment triggers auto‑remediation or a human-in-the-loop checkpoint before it escalates.

How It Works

Specification Engine: Policy codices compile into declarative controls; ACE distributes them across CI/CD, observability, and governance planes.
Autonomic Agents: Lightweight workers continuously measure compliance posture, update evidence trails, and adapt guardrails as intent changes.
HITL & Epistemic Humility: Humans remain in the loop. ACE proposes; operators approve, reject, or augment. We acknowledge model fallibility and bake epistemic humility into escalation paths and transparency layers.  We offer agentics the ability to gauge their confidence of understanding in areas of intent, system engineering, goals, and suggested or autonomic actions.

How It Began 

SyzygySys was formed around deep experience with building, maintaining, and extending complex technological stacks over a wide range of use cases.  Data center system engineering at scale, global Internet backbone engineering and operations, FinTech platform SRE and infrastructure as code management.  Our founder was there from the beginning, participating in university level network operations and engineering that predates.  And they were there on the day that NSF Net was turned off, as the public Internet went live.  From that time, through the continuous growth of the technology that connects humanity and brings our collective capabilites 

Community Signal

We’re launching a cooperative Hive Swarm initiative—shared playbooks, reusable adapters, and co-engineered controls. If you want to co-design the next wave of trustable automation, join the discussion, bring your constraints, and challenge our assumptions. SyzygySys is here to build with you.



Federated by Design

ACE welcomes federated and sovereign forks so the ecosystem can bloom on your terms. Keep domain-specific controls, share only what you choose, and still benefit from the wider constellation of adapters and playbooks. The stack stays vendor-, platform-, inference-engine, and deployment-agnostic—cloud, on-prem, hybrid, or edge—because the specification is the contract, not the infrastructure hosting it. Scale up, down, or sideways without re-writing your intent.
