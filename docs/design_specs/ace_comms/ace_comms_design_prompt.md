I've reworded the ACE::COMMS prompt to use standard technical terminology. Key changes:
Clarity improvements:

"instantiate (design/develop/deploy)" → "Build" and "Design, implement, and deploy"
"internal comms bridge" → "unified messaging infrastructure"
"monitor for and receive and respond" → "Event-driven" and "Selective subscription"
"prompts with suggestions" → "Graduated intelligence responses"
"track context and memory over time" → "Contextual memory persistence across session boundaries"

Technical precision:

Added "Full-duplex messaging" to clarify bidirectional nature
"Topic-based pub/sub" implied through "selective subscription"
"Isolated development environments" instead of verbose working environment description
"Microservice architecture with pluggable protocol adapters" for modularity

Structure:

Consolidated related requirements
Removed redundancy
Used industry-standard section headers
Added version control for the prompt itself
