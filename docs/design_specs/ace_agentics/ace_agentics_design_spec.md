ACE::AGENTICS — Design Brief (Concise)

Objective
Deliver a framework for agentic systems—internal (persona/inference) and external—supporting persistent memory, RAG over static corpora, and resumable/deterministic sessions. The system is model-, runtime-, and datastore-agnostic, and deploys on Ubuntu via Docker.

Principles & Constraints

FOSS-first or SYZ-developed; Linux POSIX-compliant; modular, swappable components.

Non-FOSS components (if any) must be self-hosted.

Standard, well-known methodologies; explicit version pinning for determinism.

Core Capabilities

Memory model:

Short-term (verbatim): full interaction transcripts scoped per task/session.

Long-term (distilled): summaries, embeddings, and key-value facts for retrieval and planning.

RAG against a static, versioned knowledge store.

Sessioning: persistent, exportable, and reloadable deterministic state (prompts, tools, params, seeds, indexes).

Temporal awareness: agents reason with wall-clock time, deadlines, SLAs, and TTLs.

HITL gating: agents initiate approval chats for high-risk/high-EHI actions; all decisions logged.

Tool use & execution: constrained “half-shell” to pull repos, run tests, and interact with limited system resources.

Multimodal ingest: text, audio/voice, images, files—normalized into the datastore and long-term memory.

Interoperability & Comms (ACE::COMMS)

Channels: text (human language), voice, file share, MCP, A2A, HTTP APIs/queues.

Protocols/Contracts: OpenAPI/JSON for HTTP, MCP for tool bridges, A2A for agent-to-agent calls.

Agents can proactively open chats for HITL, clarifications, or task updates.

Identity, Trust & Governance

Registration: all agents register with LAP::CORE Registry.

IAM: central directory (LDAP or extension) with future RBAC/ABAC; credentials scoped to least privilege.

Attestation: artifacts and critical actions recorded via ACE::LEDGER for provenance and audit.

Policies: allow/deny lists for tools, repos, networks; risk scoring via EHI with thresholds driving HITL.

Operations & SRE Use Cases

Periodic triggers prompt agents to:

Ingest/triage re-processed logs, detect regressions/drift.

Diagnose specific faults; propose and (with HITL when needed) execute remediations.

Extend ACE/LAP/LAPI via iterative integration tasks (e.g., adapting to config syntax changes).

Project tooling: first-class integrations with git and Jira for tracking and change management.

Classes of Agents

Bots: deterministic call/response or instruct/act routines.

Internal Agents: persona/inference engines with tool integrations and interfaces.

Field Agents: external engines/models accessible to ACE.

Special (Field) Agents: external agents with elevated, audited privileges.

Non-Functional Requirements

Scalability: horizontal scale of serving, memory, and RAG components.

Reliability: crash-safe checkpoints; idempotent actions with retries and backoff.

Observability: metrics, logs, traces; task timelines and HITL events correlated to ledger entries.

Security: sandboxing, signed artifacts, encrypted data at rest/in transit, secrets hygiene.

Portability: Dockerized services with explicit images/tags; infra as code.

Deployment Target

Ubuntu + Docker (compose or orchestrator). Components are independently deployable, with clearly defined interfaces for model servers, memory stores, and comms adapters.
