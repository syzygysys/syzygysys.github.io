## Portfolio Roadmap Matrix

| Domain | Focus Area | Current (Operational Today) | MVP (Next Increments) | Future / Strategic Horizon | Jira Project | Jira Epic(s) / Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| ACE | **ACE::REGISTRY** (autonomic service discovery) | Phase 1 foundations landed: core models, settings, service state machine, repo scaffolding, initial FastAPI endpoints planned ([ace_registry README](../ace/ace_registry/README.md), [chuck_session_9_rehydration](../ace/agentics/operations/personas/chuck/chuck_session_9_rehydration.md)). | Complete Phase 2–4 backlog: FastAPI app + `/announce` flow, Redis eventing, Docker/Poetry packaging, validation pipeline & MCP tooling. Demonstrate end-to-end announce → validation → discovery. | Service dependency graphs, auto load-balancing, circuit breakers, multi-region federation, GraphQL/WebSocket expansion (tracked in README future enhancements). | ACE | **ACE-7** (Epic), **ACE-8**, **ACE-10** (implementation stages). |
| ACE | **CROWN** (Capability Routing Optimization With Networking) | Vision spec + milestone breakdown ready; cost-based routing design drafted (Milestone 1) ([crown-roadmap-v0.01](../ace/crown/crown-roadmap-v0.01.md)). | Build MVP router scoring solely on cost with fallback demo (local LLM → HuggingFace → OpenAI). Instrument base telemetry for cost + TTL. | Layer latency/stability/trust/history scoring, policy controls, route dampening, hybrid cache, federation/peering. | ACE (proposed) | Create epic **ACE-CROWN-M1** for MVP; follow-on epics per Milestones 2–5. |
| ACE | **SDF & Compliance Fabric** (diagnostics, RAT, MCP contracts) | Core LAP::CORE features available: SDF diagnostics, RAT audit trail, MCP interfaces, RBAC workflows ([lap_core index](../ace/core/lap_core/index.md)). | Harden SDF level-based runs across ACE services; ensure ACE-compliant responses (noted in session logs) and RAT evidence loops across registry + agents. | Adaptive diagnostics with anomaly detection, self-healing scripts, expanded compliance scoring integrated with ACE scoring loops. | ACE | **ACE-8** subtasks (SDF enablement), future epic **ACE-SDF-HARDENING** recommended. |
| LAP | **LAP Core Platform** | FastAPI kernel, plugin loader, integration connectors, sandboxed execution, RBAC, COMMS bridge, local LLM node delivered (all ✅ in core feature matrix, [lap_core index](../ace/core/lap_core/index.md)). | Harden diagnostics & MCP coverage, finalize release v0.10.0 with tagged Docker/Helm assets; baseline AI-managed ops dashboards. | AI-managed Kubernetes orchestration, expanded REWOO planning, wider reference repo integration, self-extending script promotion pipeline. | LAP | **LAP-CORE-MVP** (defined in [windsurf_aiide.md](../code_base/windsurf_aiide.md)). |
| LAP | **Integration Pack v1** | Git + Jira integrations under development; Git read routes online, risky mutations gated by HITL ([LAP/LAPI::GIT architecture](../ace/lapi/LAP_LAPI_GIT_Architecture.md)). | Deliver trio of production-ready integrations (Git, Jira, Gemini) with test harness + plugin wheels; unlock HITL-gated mutations, finalize comms bridge verification. | Extend to Docker/MCP integration, additional SaaS connectors, policy-driven routing via CROWN. | LAP | **LAP-INT-TRIO** (Git/Jira/Gemini), **LAP-INT-DOCKER** (next connector). |
| LAP | **DevOps & Governance** | Repo/epic alignment guidance drafted; focus on docs, IP protection, DevOps pipeline vision ([windsurf_aiide.md](../code_base/windsurf_aiide.md)). | Stand up reusable CI/CD (lint/test/build/SBOM), automation linking repos↔Jira, publish docs portal. | Enterprise compliance automation, investor-readiness dashboards, community growth OKRs. | LAP | **DEVOPS-PIPELINE-V1**, **DOCS-LAUNCH**, **IP-PROTECTION**, **COMMUNITY-SEED**. |
| LAPI | **LAPI::GIT** | Read-only command surface (`/git/status`, `/git/scan`, etc.) live via LAP proxy; CLI parity for scans; HITL gating enforced for mutating ops ([LAP/LAPI::GIT architecture](../ace/lapi/LAP_LAPI_GIT_Architecture.md)). | Ship MCP/REST parity with robust error handling, enable write operations behind approval workflow, finalize fs ownership handling + test coverage. | Advanced repo automation (branch mgmt, PR orchestration), diff summarization, integration with ACE scoring + SDF hooks. | LAP (integrations) | **LAP-INT-TRIO** (component); additional story: **ACE-10** ensures response compliance. |
| LAPI | **LAPI::SHELL** | Research brief v0.1 completed: nsjail/gVisor sandbox strategy, propose→approve→run flow, audit requirements ([lapi_shell.md](../ace/lapi/lapi_shell/lapi_shell.md)). | Spike `lap_exec` sandbox runner, implement Marvin `shell.propose` tool, add policy engine + telemetry, capture transcripts. | Multi-tenant isolation (gVisor/Kata), regression harness via Testcontainers, real-time co-admin "WhisperLine" extension, TTS augmentations. | LAPI (proposed) | Create epic **LAPI-SHELL-MVP** (new) plus subordinate stories for runner, policy, audit. |
| LAPI | **Comms & Documentation Enablement** | Comms bridge HITL verification + decentralized doc effort identified as gaps ([chuck_session_9_rehydration](../ace/agentics/operations/personas/chuck/chuck_session_9_rehydration.md)). | Deliver HITL verification flows, unify doc scaffolding for LAPI repos, publish Confluence/Docs sync. | Federation-ready documentation portal, live SDF documentation linting, ACE-integrated knowledge surfacing. | LAPI | **LAPI-22** (Comms bridge HITL), **LAPI-23** (Decentralized docs). |

## Additional Notes & Source Highlights
- **ACE::REGISTRY** roadmap, states, and performance targets documented in `docs/knowledge/architecture/ace/ace_registry/README.md`.
- **CROWN** milestone ladder captured in `docs/knowledge/architecture/ace/crown/crown-roadmap-v0.01.md`.
- **LAP Core** feature matrix and roadmap in `docs/knowledge/architecture/ace/core/lap_core/index.md` and `docs/knowledge/architecture/about/about_lap_core.md`.
- **Integration Jira mapping** provided by `docs/knowledge/architecture/code_base/windsurf_aiide.md` (Repo ↔ Epic alignment).
- **LAPI::GIT** operational constraints and HITL gating described in `docs/knowledge/architecture/ace/lapi/LAP_LAPI_GIT_Architecture.md`.
- **LAPI::SHELL** safety model and implementation plan in `docs/knowledge/architecture/ace/lapi/lapi_shell/lapi_shell.md`.
- Persona rehydration sessions (e.g., `chuck_session_9/10/11/12/13`) capture Jira issue progress for ACE-7/8/10 and cross-project dependencies.

## Jira Roadmap Capability
- Jira Software **does** offer roadmap tooling. Standard plans include **Roadmaps** at the board level (suitable for grooming this table into time-phased bars). Jira Software Premium adds **Advanced Roadmaps** for cross-project planning, dependency visualization, and capacity management. Recommend: map the epics cited above into an Advanced Roadmap view to maintain alignment with this strategy artifact.
