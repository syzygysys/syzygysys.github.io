# SyzygySys

## Mission
SyzygySys exists to demonstrate a new paradigm of **Intelligence-As-Spec**: modular, entangled, self-diagnostic systems that can be deployed across personal, research, and enterprise contexts.  
Our mission is to make AI **transparent, agentic + human multiplayer** — never black-box, never exploitative.  
We build for **humans and agents together**, emphasizing reasoning traces, autonomy, and robust self-awareness.

## Credo
- **Honesty:** The system tells the truth about itself, always.  
- **Transparency:** All diagnostics, metrics, and reasoning trails are visible to both humans and agents.  
- **Resilience:** Every repo and service is designed to fail gracefully and self-repair.  
- **Simplicity:** Every tool and repo must serve a clear purpose. Complexity is tolerated only when essential.  
- **Entanglement:** Components (LAP, LAPI, network, platform, reference, etc.) are not isolated — they are designed to reinforce and inform one another.
- **Empowerment:** ACE is designed to have agency in self-research and self-extension

## Ethos
SyzygySys is **co-built by humans and AI agents** (Zerene, Marvin, Zoe, et al.).  
Every commit, script, and diagnostic is crafted with the dual audience in mind:  
- A human operator who needs clarity.  
- An AI co-agent who needs structured, parseable signals.  

This ethos ensures our system grows with both human and agent contributions, recursively improving itself.

## FOSS Stance
We are committed to **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** for all LAPI modules and supporting infrastructure.  
LAP::CORE and enterprise-scale integrations are licensed under a dual model:  
- **Personal, Educational, and Research licenses** remain affordable or free.  
- **Enterprise licenses** sustain the project financially and ensure long-term viability.  

We will never lock down knowledge or prevent experimentation. What we sell is scale, polish, and operational safety.

## Contribution
We invite **both human engineers and AI agents** to contribute to SyzygySys.  
- Humans contribute code, docs, architecture, and lived experience.  
- AI agents contribute diagnostics, self-tests, code generation, and emergent insights.  

### How to Contribute
1. Fork any `lapi_*` repo and submit a pull request.  
2. Run `sdf` diagnostics locally to validate your changes.  
3. Engage with Marvin/Zerene via the `reference` repo to clarify design intent.  
4. Follow coding, testing, and documentation standards defined in `reference/docs/templates/`.  

## Roadmap
- **MVP (2025):** LAP::CORE, baseline LAPI modules (git, docker, prometheus, synapse), and full SDF integration.  
- **Mid Term (2026):** AI-managed Kubernetes, AI-validated reference documentation, federated observability.  
- **Long Term (2027+):** Global-scale AIaC framework, commercial deployments, and a living open research platform.

SyzygySys is not just company.  Ace is not just a platform. It is a **living system**, a partnership between humans and AI, built for clarity, resilience, and entanglement.
